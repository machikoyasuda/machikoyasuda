Los Angeles, Calif. â€” Mostly reading, writing, walking and talking, Metro-ing, mapping, steeping tea, brewing coffee, committing code, data-wrangling, riding my converted electric Bridgestone XO-3, taking people camping & backpacking, joining lots of book clubs, becoming friends with plants and animals, updating OpenStreetMap, remembering, trying to swim outside and walking a cat around the San Gabriel Mountains.
